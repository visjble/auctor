# Image Slideshow with Progress Bar

This repository contains a simple JavaScript module for displaying images as a slideshow with an adjustable interval and a progress bar.

## Features

1. **File Upload**: Users can upload multiple images that they'd like to be displayed in the slideshow.
2. **Shuffled Playback**: Images are shuffled and displayed in a random order every time they're uploaded.
3. **Adjustable Interval**: The interval between images can be adjusted by the user.
4. **Progress Bar**: A progress bar shows the progression of the current image's display time.
5. **Start & Pause**: Users can start and pause the slideshow at any point.
6. **Dynamic Canvas Rendering**: The images are rendered on a canvas, and they are automatically scaled to fit within the canvas dimensions.

## Usage

1. Include the provided HTML structure in your webpage.
2. Link to the JavaScript file. It's recommended to include this right before the closing body tag (`</body>`).

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path_to_your_script.js"></script>
```

3. Style as desired. The provided code includes basic styling.

## Configuration

You can modify the default settings like canvas size and style by adjusting the HTML & CSS. If you wish to adjust the functionality or add more features, you'd need to make changes in the JavaScript file.
